# Recipes

JetBrains Academy. Project: Recipes.

<b>In first stage</b> implemented a simple service that supports two operations: adding (POST /api/recipe),
and retrieving (GET /api/recipe) a recipe. The service will be able to store only one recipe at a time.

A recipe includes 4 fields: name , description, ingredients, directions. Here's an example of the Fresh Mint Tea recipe:

{</br>
"name": "Fresh Mint Tea",</br>
"description": "Light, aromatic and refreshing beverage, ...",</br>
"ingredients": "boiled water, honey, fresh mint leaves",</br>
"directions": "1) Boil water. 2) Pour boiling hot water into a mug. 3) Add fresh mint leaves. 4) Mix and let the mint
leaves seep for 3-5 minutes. 5) Add honey and mix again."</br>
}

<b>In second stage</b>, improved the service to store a lot of recipes and access recipes by a unique id.

Rearranged the existing endpoints; the service should support the following:

POST /api/recipe/new receives a recipe as a JSON object and returns a JSON object with one id field. This is a uniquely generated number by which we can identify and retrieve a recipe later. The status code should be 200 (Ok).

GET /api/recipe/{id} returns a recipe with a specified id as a JSON object (where {id} is the id of a recipe). The server should respond with the 200 (Ok) status code. If a recipe with a specified id does not exist, the server should respond with 404 (Not found).

The new structure of a recipe includes the same 4 fields, but the type of two of them is different. ingredients and directions are arrays. Here's an example of the new structure:

{</br>
"name": "Warming Ginger Tea",</br>
"description": "Ginger tea is a warming drink for cool weather, ...",</br>
"ingredients": ["1 inch ginger root, minced", "1/2 lemon, juiced", "1/2 teaspoon manuka honey"],</br>
"directions": ["Place all ingredients in a mug and fill with warm water (not too hot so you keep the beneficial honey compounds in tact)", "Steep for 5-10 minutes", "Drink and enjoy"]</br>
}

<b>In third stage</b> implemented one of the main features of the service â€“ connect the service to a database and store 
the recipes there.

Implemented a new DELETE /api/recipe/{id} endpoint. It deletes a recipe with a specified {id}. The server should respond
with the 204 (No Content) status code. If a recipe with a specified id does not exist, the server should return 404 (Not found);
